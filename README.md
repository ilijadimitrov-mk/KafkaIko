Assamptions during making the code:
- For test we will need only one Cluster. If in future more clusters are needed this need to be changed into a module.
- Code for two types of MSK is developed: Provisioned and Serverless. Both need to be tested and with that feedback to decide how to proceed. Not much can change with Serverless type. Provisioned brings variety but we need info for proper settings. For now, default settings are used.
```
Settings for Provisioned Cluster:
- Recommended version for Kafka is 2.8.1
- Broker Type (recommended kafka.m5.large) used kafka.t3.small (for these instance type we have notification that supports up to 300 partitions per broker when you use kafka.t3.small. If you need more partitions per broker, use M5 broker types.). Also, when on m5 instance type we have the opportunity to set provisioned throughput. Here provision throughput is disable by default.
- Number of Zones - recommended 3 but will need to know where to deploy and the number of zones
- Brokers per zone 1
- Storage - recommended 1000G per broker set to 10G
- EBS storage only
- Configuration parameters (using default settings)
		auto.create.topics.enable=false
		default.replication.factor=3
		min.insync.replicas=2
		num.io.threads=8
		num.network.threads=5
		num.partitions=1
		num.replica.fetchers=2
		replica.lag.time.max.ms=30000
		socket.receive.buffer.bytes=102400
		socket.request.max.bytes=104857600
		socket.send.buffer.bytes=102400
		unclean.leader.election.enable=true
		zookeeper.session.timeout.ms=18000
- Networking - using existing VPC. We need feedback on how to set up the cluster. Does it need to have public access or not. Recommended not to have public access and the cluster should be in the same VPC as the AAPP servers. Public access to MSK is not enabled.
- Security Groups - who need access. Access is allowed by instance SG accessing the server. Now is open for any access from APP side. Works on TCP port 9098.During test to be changed to accept access only from this port.
- IAM access to server. IAM based policy access is defined. Policy is created and role to add the policy is created. On Production account attached policies need to be added as needed for the instances.
- TLS encryption is enabled by default.
- Monitoring is set to basic.
- Monitoring with Prometheus is enabled but not tested.
- Logs are pushed to CloudWatch. Possibility to have them on S3. Needs retention period to be set (currently is 14 days).
- Auto Scaling for Storage is created. Needs changing values as product needs.
```

```
Settings for Serverless Cluster:
Ã€ that is permitted to set is the IAM access, SG and Subnets where to deploy.
What we get from Serverless see image.
```

![alt text](IMG2.png "All Cluster Settings")

According to feedback from Dev on requirement we can change the settings as needed.

### Terraform Global Configuration

Files:
- 00_config.auto.tfvars
Need values for subnets, region and VPC. Further to be set and get the values with DATA.
- 00_provider.tf
Set to local repo. Once migrated to TF Cloud needs to be accordingly changed.
- 01_variables.tf
Definition for all needed variables so the code can work.

### Terraform Resorcece

- 10_sg_for_kafka_cluster.tf 
Security group. Access is filtered by source instance SG.
- 11_iam_policy_for_kafka.tf 
Policy to allow instances to access Kafka Cluster. The policy needs to be added to the existing instance Role.
- 12_iam_server_role_with_kafka_policy.tf
Instance role containing needed policy is created. This needs to be set according to Time 247 policy requirements for access.
- 13_MSK_auto_scale_storage.tf
Scaling Group set to 70% usage.
- 14_MSK_log_group.tf
Log group is created where logs will be pushed. Retention period is 14 days.
- 15_msk_configuration.tf
Conf file with concrete settings how the cluster should behave. Needs to be updated according to Dev requests.


### Main Configuration Provisioned Cluster
- 30_MSK_Provisioned.tf
MSK provisioned cluster configuration.

### Main Configuration Serverless Cluster
- 40_MSK_Serverless.tf
MSK Serverless Cluster Configuration.


## Installing Server to test

Creation of EC2 instance to manage the cluster is not done by Terraform. If needed can be created and installed so we can create the Topics, but we expect that this will be handled by the APP.

For test purposes Linux 2 EC2 instance was created.

Installation steps:


```
sudo yum -y install java-11
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.8.1/kafka_2.13-2.8.1.tgz
tar -xzf kafka_2.13-2.8.1.tgz
wget https://github.com/aws/aws-msk-iam-auth/releases/download/v1.1.1/aws-msk-iam-auth-1.1.1-all.jar

cd kafka_2.13-2.8.1/bin
vim client.properties
    ecurity.protocol=SASL_SSL
    asl.mechanism=AWS_MSK_IAM
    asl.jaas.config=software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMLoginModule required;
    asl.client.callback.handler.class=software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMClientCallbackHandler

From the MSK get the broker endpoint. One is enough.

Command to create Topic:

 ./kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server b-2.sysopsmsktest.a2w4xb.c4.kafka.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:9098 --replication-factor 3 --partitions 1 --topic MSKTutorialTopic --command-config client.properties

Command for the Producer:

  ./kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list b-2.sysopsmsktest.a2w4xb.c4.kafka.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:9098 --producer.config client.properties --topic MSKTutorialTopic

Command for the Consumer:

/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server b-2.sysopsmsktest.a2w4xb.c4.kafka.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:9098 --consumer.config client.properties --topic MSKTutorialTopic --from-beginning

```

And it works. :)

This is being saved in Terraform State:
```
$ terraform.exe state list
aws_appautoscaling_policy.kafka_broker_scaling_policy
aws_appautoscaling_target.kafka_storage
aws_cloudwatch_log_group.MSKLogs

When destroying the Provisioned Cluster you mast destroy also 13_MSK_auto_scale_storage.tf.

## GIT Action

Code is in GIT and GIT Actions were implemented.

![alt text](IMG3.png "Git Action Report")

At start Git Action reported few best practise improvements:
- retention of logs to be gt 1 year (set to 400 days)
- KMS encription for logs (creating KMS Key)
- KMS encription for Kafka (creating KMS key)
